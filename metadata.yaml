description: "The Crater, or Vulcan's Peak: a Tale of the Pacific is a novel by James\
  \ Fenimore Cooper first published in 1847.\nFrom merely surviving the loss of his\
  \ shipmates and the embayment of his ship within The Reef, protagonist and role-model\
  \ Mark Woolston goes on to thrive by his own industry. Following a regional volcanic\
  \ upheaval which raises new land, he founds a similarly industrious and thriving\
  \ colony after escaping from, then returning to, The Reef. The outnumbered colonists\
  \ must defend their new homes and possessions against natives who covet the new\
  \ land.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
